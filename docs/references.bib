	abstract = {The apparel industry, which includes the clothing/garment sector, encompasses the supply chain of clothing and garments, starting with the textile and fashion industry, all the way to fashion retailers and the trade with second-hand clothes and textile recycling. This sector is characterized by substantial wastes, which may be minimized by means of textile recycling. This paper reports on the results of an international study on sustainable clothing consumption. This paper identifies and analyzes attitudes and behaviors regarding the clothing industry in a sample of 203 individuals. The results suggest a number of trends. Firstly, they show the complexity of purchase habits. The reasons why individuals dispose of their old or not used clothes are manifold, and include objective and subjective factors. Also, the paper illustrates the existence of disparities in respect of clothing use and disposal behavior. Finally, the results suggest that there is a need for more awareness-raising initiatives, in order to make consumers more conscious about the options available and the need for a more sustainable use of clothing.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study of 232 college students was framed by Ajzen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action and examined factors that motivate and influence college students' clothing disposal behaviours. Using survey questionnaires, we investigated four different clothing disposal options (resale, donation, reusing and discarding) and examined five motivational factors (environmental, economic, charity and convenience concerns and information unavailability). The influences of attitudes towards the environment and subjective norms of family and friends on clothing disposal behaviours also were examined. Results indicated that resale and donation behaviours were explained by environmental concerns and that reuse and resale behaviours were explained by economic concerns. Charity concerns motivated donation behaviours and convenience motivated discarding behaviours. Further, findings indicated that family subjective norms influenced environmentally motivated resale and donation behaviours.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to explore global research on individuals’ awareness and behaviours related to the Circular Economy, aiming to deepen the understanding of how people engage with and contribute to CE practices. Design/methodology/approach Using a systematic literature review (SLR), this study methodically collects, codifies, analyses, synthesizes and interprets existing literature and research on Circular Economy. This approach aims for a comprehensive understanding of current global perspectives and practices. Findings The analysis reveals an increasing trend in empirical research focusing on Circular Economy strategies. This paper has identified 22 key strategies linked to public awareness and behaviours towards Circular Economy, noting that purchasing recycled products is the most commonly observed behaviour. The findings highlight the growing importance and complexity of individual roles in the Circular Economy. Research limitations/implications The study underscores the importance of consumer behaviour in advancing Circular Economy practices. This paper observes that despite the growth in Circular Economy research, there is still a notable gap in awareness and behaviour, even in developed countries. This is attributed to a lack of conceptual understanding, educational disparities, resource limitations, a limited grasp of cost–benefit considerations and inadequate government support. The paper also explores regional and sector-specific variations in Circular Economy adoption, with insights from countries such as the USA, China, the UK, Germany, France and Norway. Practical implications This study underscores the importance of consumer behaviour in advancing Circular Economy practices.

The paper also explores regional and sector-specific variations in Circular Economy adoption, with insights from countries such as the USA, China, the UK, Germany, France and Norway. Social implications This research underscores the impact of demographic and sociocultural factors, including age, education, social norms and attitudes, on Circular Economy engagement. It identifies potential research areas, including examining cultural influences on social and personal norms related to circular behaviours. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the need for a coordinated, cross-sectoral effort to facilitate a sustainable transition to a Circular Economy, addressing barriers and fostering awareness and behaviours conducive to circular practices. Originality/value This study acknowledges challenges affecting the maturity of Circular Economy practices, including a lack of comprehension, educational disparities, resource constraints and limited government support. It also underscores the impact of social and cultural factors on Circular Economy engagement. It suggests promising avenues for future research, providing valuable insights into the state of Circular Economy practices and offering a roadmap for advancing global sustainability initiatives.},

	abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;Second-hand shopping as a segment in the retail industry has grown rapidly over the years. Apparel resale is expected to grow 6\% by 2025, showcasing \$25 billion chunk of the \$425 billion retail industry in 2025 (Sutter, 2016). The primary purpose of this study was to examine second-hand shopping purchase intentions online and through social media. The secondary purpose was to analyze consumer attitudes, behaviors, and purchase intentions toward second-hand shopping online and through social media based on consumers’ gender and income level. Correlation testing results found statistically significant relationship between attitudes toward purchasing second-hand clothing online as well as through social media platforms and purchase intentions. Respondents indicated that they would buy secondhand clothing online and through social media if the sizing was more accurate and true to present day (r=.695), if the site provided images on how to best style the fashion item (r=.445), and if the second-hand shopping online platform was fast and convenient (r=.645). Additionally, low income female (vs. male) consumers indicated that they buy more second-hand clothing items per month than middle and high income consumer groups.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

	abstract = {Second-hand consumption has been quietly undergoing a makeover in recent years. As part of this shift, the concept of shopping for second-hand goods has been redefined. In today's retail marketplace, a mix of thrift stores, high-end stores, and online retailers are recognising the value of second-hand and hosting flea markets or launching their own vintage product collections. However, limited research attention has been paid to role of ‘fashionability’ as a motivation for consumers to shop for second-hand goods. In this study, we explore modern consumer second-hand shopping behaviour and motivations, inclusive of fashionability. Through a segmentation of second-hand store shoppers, we identify four distinct segments. While we find a polarisation of fashionability motivations, the vast majority (83\%) of second-hand shoppers are driven by fashion when shopping in second-hand stores. The findings present several implications for second-hand retailers, including new ways to expand their customer base by tapping into elements of fashionability.},
