## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
Data was collected using a survey questionnaire created in Google Forms, which included questions about demographics (age, gender, education, income, continent of origin), environmental awareness, clothing purchasing habits, and clothing disposal practices. All clothing purchasing and disposal questions were dichotomous choice questions (yes or no). Responses were gathered in two ways: (1) via a link shared on WhatsApp with ETH students, and (2) through a QR code distributed to ETH members on Polyterrace over a one-hour period.

2.  Methods for processing the data:
A total of 20 responses were recorded, and the raw data was exported to Google Sheets. Data cleaning and analysis were conducted in Quarto using R scripts.
